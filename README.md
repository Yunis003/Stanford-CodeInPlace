# Stanford University - Code in Place Program

Welcome to my repository! I am currently working through the **Code in Place** program at Stanford University, which provides an introduction to programming concepts and problem-solving skills in Python and other areas of computer science.

## üìö Program Overview

The **Code in Place** program at Stanford University covers a variety of essential computer science topics, allowing me to develop a solid understanding of programming and software development. Throughout this program, I have been learning key programming concepts and techniques, such as:

- **Stepwise Refinement**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks to ensure effective problem-solving.
- **Python Control Flow**: Understanding the fundamentals of decision-making and loops to control the flow of a program.
- **Intro to Python**: Gaining a strong foundation in Python programming, including syntax, variables, and functions.
- **Graphics**: Learning to create visual content and interactive graphics using Python libraries.
- **Data**: Understanding data structures, manipulation, and working with different types of data in Python.
- **Animation**: Creating animations using Python to visualize dynamic changes over time.

## üíª Skills & Technologies

During the course of this program, I have been using various Python libraries and tools, such as:

- **Python**: Core programming language for the tasks and projects.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating basic visualizations and graphics.
- **Turtle**: A popular library used for graphics and animations in Python.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Projects

Here is a list of some of the projects I have worked on as part of the **Code in Place** program:

1. **Interactive Graphics**: Creating simple drawings and animations using Python's Turtle library.
2. **Data Structures**: Implementing and using basic data structures to solve programming challenges.
3. **Control Flow Exercises**: Writing Python code to practice loops, conditions, and iterations for real-world problem solving.
4. **Animation Projects**: Developing animations that illustrate dynamic systems and mathematical concepts.

## üöÄ Future Work

I will continue working on refining my skills in Python and exploring advanced topics related to:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Algorithms and problem-solving techniques
- More complex graphics and animation projects
